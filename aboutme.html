    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My goal in life is to have exceptional grades, and achieve my childhood dream to play lacrosse at John Hopkins. During college I want to be able
      to obtain a realtor’s license to create a flow of income to stay steady. This will allow me to one day open modifications work shop to make clients
      vehicles customized effortlessly.  I am focusing on academics during the day and whenever I have free time it’s for lacrosse. Then on my career 
      side I will study and research so that I can get my license at eighteen. Then one day I will open my shop.  Hard work and Focus are the keys to
      my future, if I can keep these two key details then I don’t see me being stopped from accomplishing my dreams. Focus will get me threw school with
      good GPA, which is needed to go to any college. Hard work will keep me from giving up and stopping what I love.  I hope to create a solid income
      right now so I can get a jumpstart on my life. I will learn and educate myself to important parts of life such as investment opportunities, etc.
      My solid income ideas should give me more opportunities as a high schooler as well. I want to be known as a Hard worker and a nice guy, and whatever
      he said he would do he did. I want to achieve my goals and know that I did what I set my mind to. I want people to think that everyday I beat
      myself and got better every time I worked hard. I want to be known for my drive and focus on something I want to achieve.
